This helps the marinade permeate and the chicken cook faster",
            para1: "Tandoori Chicken is a classic Indian grilled meat dish known for its bright red-orange color. This recipe was actually a mix between trying to stay true to the classic restaurant favorite recipe while making an easy weeknight meal. Its also super affordable using using chicken legs. The cost savings isnt the only reason to use drumsticks, the drumstick is the most popular and favorite part of the chicken, and with this recipe everyone gets a piece",

            para2: "The other great thing about using chicken legs for this recipe is that they stay tender while cooking quickly. They have just enough meat to stay tender while getting a slightly crispy exterior from the marinade. This means more of the meat is super flavorful.",
